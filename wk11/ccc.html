                People feel differently about specific designs, and that is fine. For this reason, we at MoRewa have decided to do our designs in collections. This way, people can ock the same designs and say the same thing in different patterns.
            Available in three solid colors, Black, White, and Gray, the "Angry Me" collection portrays a vector design illustrated by Shakes The Creator, designed by Taite Hutchason, and produced by Joshua Olaoye.
            This collection is available at a selected location across Lagos State, Nigeria. We hope you have much fun expressing your feelings about our design.
            Materials: 100% Cotton
